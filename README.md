# Skeet Generator v1.0


> Skeet Generator v1.0; the generator built for generating Discord Nitro Gifts, Minecraft TFAs, etc, etc


Skeet Generator v1.0, also known as Skeet Gen, made by bloxsense#0001, is a user-dedicated tool to generate anything random, which, Skeet Gen can do. Compared to DortGen, it is more slower then DortGen. However, it's multi-use, open-source, and cannot be patched for a couple of months.


Skeet Gen was originally a project, which, was a joke. However, after getting a working Xbox code, was made into a actual generator itself.
